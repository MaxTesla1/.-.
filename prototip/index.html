                Here's a time line of Max life:

            </h3> 
            <ul>
            
            <li><strong>2001</strong> Born in Rusiia, litle town Orsk.</li>
                <li><strong>2008</strong> At the age of 7, he goes to the first grade at the local school No. 29.Mom takes me to the pool and from that moment begins the 10-year journey of swimming.</li>
                <li><strong>2013</strong> Having finished 4 classes, he is transferred to a stronger school at number 8, where one class is studying.</li>
                <li><strong>2015</strong> Moves with his family to the Krasnodar Territory, the city of Novorossiysk and goes to school number 28. Starts playing sports - sea all-around.</li>
            <li><strong>2017</strong> Finish 9th grade and stay at 10.11.</li>

            <li><strong>2022</strong> I learned that many friends are programming and even some work in this field. There was a wild interest in this one and the titanic work on learning Java Script began. </li>
                <li><strong>2022</strong> This year my interesting journey into the world of programming began.</li>
            
            </ul>
            
            <p>Most good programmers do their jobs not because they expect to be paid or recognized, but because they enjoy programming.
